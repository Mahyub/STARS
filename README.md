## STARS: Stability-Aware SFC Orchestration and User Association in LEO Satellite Networks

This repository contains the official implementation of **STARS**, our framework for stability-aware service function chain (SFC) orchestration and user association in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks. This codebase accompanies our paper, which is currently under review, and will be made publicly available to foster reproducibility, and further research in this area.

The STARS framework is implemented in **Julia**, leveraging the **JuMP** modeling language for mathematical optimization. We employ **Gurobi 11.0.2** as the optimization solver. By sharing our code, we aim to help the research community validate our results and build upon our work.

> **Note:** This work is currently under review. The code will be released soonâ€”stay tuned!

We encourage researchers and practitioners to use, test, and extend this implementation once it is available. If you have questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or contact us on mohammed.mahyoub@carleton.com
